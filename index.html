    Frequently Asked Questions

<button class="accordion">Why are there so many electricity-generating coal plants near Meigs County? </button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Coal has been a dominant industry for most of the region’s history. The county’s newest mine began producing coal last February. 
    An experimental site for carbon capture and sequestration, a technology to store carbon dioxide underground, is under construction in West Virginia near Meigs County's southern border. In addition, a coal-to-liquids facility and two other coal-fired power plants have been proposed for the region, although at least some of those plans appear to be on hold.
    Meanwhile, Meigs County is one of the poorest counties in Ohio, according to 2000 U.S. Census data. Elisa Young, a Meigs County resident who has organized opposition to the new plant, argues that poverty reduces local opposition to the coal industry. 
     “When you have an economy that's entirely wrapped around coal, you can't speak out about it,” she says.

<button class="accordion">What’s the connection between coal and electricity?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Nearly 50 percent of U.S. electricity comes from coal. Coal-fired power plants burn coal to generate steam, which is used to turn the turbines of an electrical generator. 
    The U.S. has one of the largest coal reserves in the world and burns it at about 600 plants across the nation. Generating electricity from coal is common in the South and in the heartland, but less often used in regions such as the West Coast, where hydroelectricity and natural gas are bigger sources of power.

<button class="accordion">What’s next? </button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Before construction can begin on a new coal plant, an energy company must receive pollution permits from a state regulatory authority. 
    Carson, the American Municipal Power spokesman, said his utility has received all the permits it needs and that construction on the plant will start in late 2009 or early 2010. 
    Opponents of the plant have appealed the plant’s permits. The state of Ohio will allow construction to proceed during the appeals process.
